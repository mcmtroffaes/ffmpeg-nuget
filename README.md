# ffmpeg-nuget

A nuget package containing headers, import libraries, and runtime dlls for FFmpeg based on the [official builds](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), to make it easier to compile MSVC projects against the official ffmpeg libraries.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vcsn0fpr5s1j6p2y/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mcmtroffaes/ffmpeg-nuget/branch/master)

**I am planning to retire this nuget package from October 1st 2020 onward, since zeranoe is closing and will no longer be providing any builds. Visual Studio has nowadays excellent integration with vcpkg. Pre-built vcpkg archives are available from [ffmpeg-msvc-build](https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/ffmpeg-msvc-build/releases), or simply build ffmpeg yourself using vcpkg.**

## Requirements

* [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/)

## Usage

A prebuilt nuget package can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FFmpeg.Nightly/). If you want to build your own nuget package, then:

  * Use ``install.ps1`` to download and extract the relevant FFmpeg dev and shared builds for both 32 bit and 64 bit.
  * Use ``build.ps1`` to regenerate the lib files using Visual Studio 14.0 tools.
  * Use ``nuget pack FFmpeg.Nightly.nuspec`` to create the nuget package.
