This nuget package contains headers, import libraries, and runtime
dlls for FFmpeg for use with Visual Studio. It is based on the
official FFmpeg windows builds from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

FFmpeg is a pure C project, so to use the libraries within your C++
application you must encompass your FFmpeg includes using extern "C".
Otherwise, you will experience link errors. For more details, see
